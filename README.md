# Pairs assignment 

Please look at the following before commencing on this work:

+ [Pair Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html): The "rules" from [
www.extremeprogramming.org](www.extremeprogramming.org).
+ [All I Really Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten][Kindergarten]: Good suggestions on how to program in pairs..

## Overview

In pair programming, you and your partner are both physically present and work collaboratively at one computer. 
One person is the *”driver”* and types the code into the computer. 
The other person is called the *”navigator”* and actively checks the work entered by the driver. 
Each partner spends about one-half of the time for each assignment as the driver and the other half as the reviewer. 
Together, you and your partner should discuss and implement the design, produce the code and run the tests on the code. 
Each solution must be a true joint effort equally owned, created and understood by both partners (students).

Splitting up the assignment into parts and working on them separately is **not permitted** and violates both the letter and the spirit of the academic honesty code for this course. 
Working together virtually, for example through shared desktops or Skype calls, also violates the code (unless approved in advance by your instructor).

## Rules of Pair Programming

+ You must work with one other student of this class, no more and no less, for the assignment.
+ When working together, you must work together physically in the same place on one computer, to edit, compile, and test your code.
+ Periodically, about every half-hour, change who uses the keyboard and mouse so that each student has a chance to *drive*.
+ You must both turn in the same project code, although only one GitHub Classroom repository will be submitted.
+ Both repositories should include a `PARTNER.md` file containing the names of the partners; one repo will also include the submitted code.
A sample `PARTNER.md` file is included in this repository.

## FAQ

+ “If my partner did not help with most of the assignment, should I still put his or her name on the assignment?”

	Yes, but you should note this in the comments field of the `PARTNER.md` file. 
	If the pairing is *braking down* you should inform the instructor as soon as possible. 
	If this is too near the submission time, and you need to complete the remainder of the assignment on your own, then you should turn in your assignment as usual.

+ “If I start working on an assignment with a partner, and then change my mind, what can I do?”

	Once you pair program, you cannot change your mind and complete the program alone or with a different partner. 
	Instead, you must inform the instructor as to why your pair has *broken down*. 
	If given permission to continue alone you must erase all your code and start over. 
	If your assignment is similar to another student's, and the other student is not a declared pair-programming partner, then you will need to answer questions regarding academic integrity.

+ “If I don’t even try to be in a pair and just submit the work as an individual will my work be graded?”

	No - you will receive feedback but the grade will be zero.
